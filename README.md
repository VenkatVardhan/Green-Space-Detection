Urban Green Space Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on the detection of urban green spaces using deep learning techniques. The detection is performed using ResNet and U-Net models, leveraging the UGSET dataset specifically designed for urban green space analysis.
Urban green spaces are vital for maintaining ecological balance in cities, providing benefits such as air purification, temperature regulation, and recreational areas for residents. Accurate detection and mapping of these spaces are essential for urban planning and environmental management.

This project aims to automate the detection of urban green spaces using deep learning models. By leveraging the power of ResNet and U-Net architectures, the project provides an efficient and scalable solution for identifying green areas in urban environments.

Dataset
UGSET
The dataset used in this project is the UGSET (Urban Green Space Evaluation and Tracking) dataset, a comprehensive collection of satellite images that include diverse urban environments. The dataset has been annotated to mark various green spaces, making it an ideal resource for training and evaluating deep learning models for this task.


ResNet
ResNet (Residual Networks) is a deep learning model designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in very deep networks. In this project, ResNet is used for feature extraction, providing a robust foundation for identifying urban green spaces in complex environments.

U-Net
U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation, but it has proven to be effective in various image segmentation tasks. In this project, U-Net is used to segment urban green spaces from satellite images, enabling precise detection and localization of these areas.
